## Introduction

Complex numbers play a crucial role in various fields, including engineering, physics, and computer science. The argument of a complex number, often referred to as the phase, is a fundamental concept. It helps in understanding the direction of the vector representing the complex number in the complex plane. 

In this repository, you will find a simple and efficient way to compute the argument of a single-precision complex floating-point number in radians. 

## Features

- **Simple API**: Easy to integrate into your projects.
- **Single-Precision Support**: Focused on single-precision complex floating-point numbers.
- **Radians Output**: Provides the argument in radians for consistency in calculations.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for quick setup.

## Installation

To install the package, you can use npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install math-base-special-cphasef
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the package in your JavaScript code. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

```javascript
const cphasef = require('math-base-special-cphasef');

const realPart = 1.0; // Real part of the complex number
const imaginaryPart = 1.0; // Imaginary part of the complex number

const argument = cphasef(realPart, imaginaryPart);
console.log(`The argument of the complex number is: ${argument} radians`);
```

## API Reference

### `cphasef(real, imaginary)`

- **Parameters**:
  - `real` (number): The real part of the complex number.
  - `imaginary` (number): The imaginary part of the complex number.
  
- **Returns**: The argument of the complex number in radians.

### Example

```javascript
const angle = cphasef(0, 1); // Ï€/2
console.log(angle); // Outputs: 1.5707963267948966
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```javascript
const cphasef = require('math-base-special-cphasef');

const arg1 = cphasef(1, 0); // 0 radians
console.log(`Argument of (1 + 0i): ${arg1}`);

const arg2 = cphasef(0, 1); // Ï€/2 radians
console.log(`Argument of (0 + 1i): ${arg2}`);

const arg3 = cphasef(-1, 0); // Ï€ radians
console.log(`Argument of (-1 + 0i): ${arg3}`);

const arg4 = cphasef(0, -1); // -Ï€/2 radians
console.log(`Argument of (0 - 1i): ${arg4}`);
```

### Example 2: Complex Numbers

```javascript
const cphasef = require('math-base-special-cphasef');

const complex1 = cphasef(3, 4); // 0.927 radians
console.log(`Argument of (3 + 4i): ${complex1}`);

const complex2 = cphasef(-3, -4); // -2.214 radians
console.log(`Argument of (-3 - 4i): ${complex2}`);
```
